rapiddisk-on-boot (2.0.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Changed Build-Depends to adapt to the new dependency relations between 'dkms' and 'dh_dkms'
    starting with Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic.
  * Now four packages are created, rapiddisk, rapiddisk-dkms and
    rapiddisk-on-boot, plus the debugging package.
